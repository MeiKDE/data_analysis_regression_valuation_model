# Multivariable Regression and Valuation Model

## Overview
This Jupyter Notebook explores multivariable regression techniques to build a real estate valuation model based on historical housing data from Boston, Massachusetts in the 1970s. The goal is to analyze how different features influence housing prices and develop a predictive model for property valuation.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this analysis contains various features of Boston housing, including:
- Crime rate
- Property tax rate
- Number of rooms per dwelling
- Accessibility to highways
- Proximity to employment centers
- And more...

## Key Components
1. **Data Preprocessing**
   - Import necessary libraries (Pandas, NumPy, Seaborn, Plotly, Matplotlib, Scikit-learn)
   - Load and explore the dataset
   - Handle missing values and outliers
   
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
   - Visualizing distributions and correlations
   - Identifying important features using scatter plots, heatmaps, and histograms

3. **Building the Regression Model**
   - Performing linear regression
   - Evaluating model performance using RÂ² score and residual analysis

4. **Model Interpretation and Visualization**
   - Plotting regression coefficients
   - Understanding feature importance
   - Predicting housing prices based on the model

## Setup Instructions
To run this notebook locally:

1. Install required dependencies:
   ```sh
   pip install pandas numpy seaborn plotly matplotlib scikit-learn
   ```
2. Open Jupyter Notebook and run `Multivariable_Regression_and_Valuation_Model_(complete).ipynb`

## Dependencies
- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook
- Pandas, NumPy, Seaborn, Plotly, Matplotlib, Scikit-learn

## Usage
